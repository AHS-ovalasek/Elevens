2. 6
4. Yes, if they are ordered differently the array will be a different size. 

Activity 3 Questions
1. Random r = new Random();
public static void flip(){
	int num = r.nextInt(3);
	if(num == 1 || num == 3){
	System.out.println("Heads");
	}else{
	System.out.println("Tails");
	}
}
2. if(array1 == array2){
return true;
}else{
false;
}
3.4,3,2,1
Activity 6 Questions
1. (5 of clubs w/ 6 of spades) 
2. Yes, a deck of cards has an even number of cards, if the deck only has 3 cards left they must be J, Q and K.
3. No, the game does not involve strategy, only skill when the cards are dealt because all plays in every game are the same.

Activity 7 Questions
1. Deck of cards
2. The deck of cards needs to be dealt randomly and when the user has a pair, another pair of random cards are dealt.
3. No, the Elevens Board does not contain the card class or the deck class which are needed to run the program.
4. a. It is called whenever the Elevens Board is not debugging.
b. They should be in the ElevensBoard method.
c. 0, 1, 3, 6, 7
d. for (int k = 0; k < cards.length; k++) {
			if (cards[k] != null) {
				System.Out.Print(cards[k]);
			}
		}
e. ElevensBoard because without knowing where cards are and aren't located the program won't be able to point out pairs.

Activity 8 Questions
1. The Elevens, Tens and Thirteens boards are all boards and include some of the same methods but also include different methods, 
the Thirteens Board includes the containsJQK method while the TensBoard does not.
2. The methods in the main Board are abstract methods and can be called by other Boards if it recognizes it as a board.
3. The abstract methods are "isLegal" and "anotherPlayIsPossible". In the ElevensBoard they are implemented as public methods.
No, it is an abstract method that will be the same on any board.

Activity 9 Questions
1. The size doesn't affect the code, some methods are still the same.
2. All boards select, remove, and replace cards the same way.
3. No, since the board class is no longer abstract there would be no methods specific to the decks and would not work.
